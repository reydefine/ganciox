# Federation

Gancio is a federated application. This means that it can interact with other federated applications, such as Mastodon, Pleroma, Friendica, WordPress, Mobilizon, etc.
This interaction is possible thanks to the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) protocol.


##### Following a Gancio website from the Fediverse

If federation is enabled (`Admin > Federation > Turn on Federation`, true by default), you can follow a Gancio website directly from any other compatible website.

<!-- 

"Follow Me" Button: On a federated Gancio site, you will find a "Follow Me" button in the footer. Clicking it allows you to follow the node effortlessly.

Manually: Add the ActivityPub handle of the Gancio node to your federated platform. For example: @gancio@gancio.cisti.org or your URL too.

Once you follow a node, no manual approval is required. All published events will appear in your timeline or calendar.





#### Interacting with Events

Gancio supports social interactions with events:

Comments and Media: Respond to events with comments, images, or audio. These will appear on the event page (if the option is enabled).

Likes and Boosts: You can send "Likes" and "Boosts" to events. These actions enhance the event's visibility if configured to display them.

3. Moderation

Gancio provides tools for managing unwanted content:

User Moderation: You can moderate comments and content from specific users or federated nodes.
Instance Blocking: If necessary, you can block entire instances or fediverse actors. This prevents undesired interactions and protects your community.

4. Following Someone from Gancio

Gancio allows you to follow other federated platforms, such as another Gancio node, Mobilizon, or WordPress:

Receiving Events: Following a fediverse actor lets you receive events from that source, which will appear on your home feed by default unless configured otherwise.

Collections and Filters: Organize incoming events into Collections based on tags, federated nodes, or specific locations.

Collections can be displayed on your homepage or dedicated pages.
Filters help define which events are shown and how they are grouped.

#### Follow this site
You can follow this site from your own federated accounts (e.g. from Mastodon) to receive events.

Note that removed and modified events are updated on federation.

#### Interact with this site
You can interact with events from the federation, for example by replying with images, audio, comments, likes or boosts.
If enabled thoose interactions will be visible on the event page.

#### Follow another site
You can follow another federated site to receive events from it.

The website you are going to follow must be compatible with ActivityPub.

Following another intance will add events published on the followed instance to your home page by default.

If you need to show only some of the events from the followed instance, you can create a collection and choose the filter you want by speficying instances, tags, etc.
